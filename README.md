# TiSnAu Alloy Simulation Project

This repository presents a conceptual and simulated alloy composed of Titanium (Ti), Tin (Sn), and Gold (Au) 
designed for lightweight, heat-dissipating, and EMI-shielding applications.

## Composition (Example)
- Titanium (Ti): 85%
- Tin (Sn): 12%
- Gold (Au): 3%

## Key Properties (Estimated via Simulation)
- Electrical Conductivity: 4.30 × 10⁶ S/m
- Density: 5.28 g/cm³
- Thermal Conductivity: 36.14 W/m·K
- Melting Point: 1477.6°C

## Potential Applications
- Smartphone or mobile device chassis
- EMI shielding panels
- Lightweight heat dissipation structures
- Energy storage casing materials
